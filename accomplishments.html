<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
	
	<div class="par">
  <p> The New York Yankees are undoubtedly the most successful franchise in North American sports. From 1903 to 2020, the Yankees have won a grand total of 10,411 games and lost 7,867 games, giving them a .570 winning percentage. The Yankees have won a grand total of 27 World Series, most recently in 2009, 40 American League Pennants, and 19 American League East Division titles. Their first championship came in 1923 with the help of superstar Babe Ruth. From there, the Yankees would not look back. A few years later, in 1927, 1928, and 1932, the Yankees would go on to secure titles. They would win every year from 1936 to 1939 and won five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953. Their propsperity would continue into the early 1960s until a 15 year title drought prevented them from winning another champioship until they did so in consecutive years in 1977 and 1978. Over the next decade and a half, the Yankees would be mediocre until their dynasty of the late 1990s. Between 1996 to 2000, the Yankees won 4 championships. To this day, no team has one consecutive World Series titles since the Yankees were able to do so. Adding on, 44 players and 11 managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Some of these greats include Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mariano Rivera, and Derek Jeter. The Yankees are also the most valuable organization in MLB, worth approximately $5 billion. This wealth allows the organization to pursue many top-tier players. This enourmous success and constant winning is one of the reasons of the Yankees' popularity around the globe and their fans being so passionate and prideful.
