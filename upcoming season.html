<h1>Upcoming Season</h1>
   <p>Entering the 2021 season, the New York Yankees face a tremendous amount of pressure to make it to the World Series after failing to do so in over a decade. With the major re-signing of key contributer, DJ LeMahieu, and the signing of former Cy Young Award Winning Pitcher, Corey Kluber, the Yankees should make it. They've also acquired a solid pitcher in Jameson Taillon and recieved bullpen help after the signing of Darren O' Day. On paper, the Yankees are the best team in the American League. The Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, Houston Asterisks, and the Chicago White Sox, seem to be the only teams that can keep up with them. However, in the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, and the San Diego Padres can certainly compete with the Yankees for a potential World Series title. The Yankees will look to see if they can achieve that goal.
