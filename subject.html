  <h2>History</h2>
  <p> The New York Yankees are one of the oldest organizations in Major League Baseball. They were established in 1901 where they competed in Baltimore, Maryland as the Orioles for two seasons. In 1903, the team was under new ownership when they relocated to New York City. There, they were called the New York Highlanders as they were located in one of Manhattan's highest points, Hilltop Park. In 1913, the Highlanders began to play at the Polo Grounds, just north of Central Park, and were renamed as the New York Yankees. The Yankees played in the Polo Grounds until 1922 when they moved to Yankee Stadium in the western side of the Bronx. They played in the stadium for many years until 2008. The following year the Yankees moved to a new stadium just across the street of their former home. This new stadium is also called Yankee Stadium.

  <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
  <p> The New York Yankees are undoubtedly the most successful franchise in North American sports. The Yankees have won a grand total of 27 World Series, most recently in 2009, 40 American League Pennants, and 19 American League East Division titles. Adding on, 44 players and 11 managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Some of these greats include Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mariano Rivera, and Derek Jeter. The Yankees are also the most valuable organization in MLB, worth approximately $5 billion. This wealth allows the organization to pursue many top-tier players.

  <h2>Rivalries</h2>
  <p>
    <h3> Boston Red Sox </h3>
      <p> One of the most well-known rivalries in sports is the rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. This rivalry originated in 1919, ever since the Boston Red Sox sold the contract of Babe Ruth, arguably the greatest player to ever play baseball, to the New York Yankees. With Babe Ruth, the Yankees experienced great success and many titles. Without him, the Red Sox struggled mightily. They weren't able to win a championship until 2004. These games are often played with high stakes and with hatred among players and fans. </p>
  <h3> New York Mets </h3>
  <p> These close neighbors play each other every year in a series of games known as the "Subway Series". Fans from both teams tune in, in an attempt to determine who "rules" the city. For all of time, the Yankees have undisputedly dominated the Mets. </p>
  <h3> Houston Asterisks/Astros </h3>
    <p> This one has emerged over the past couple of years. The New York Yankees have met with the Houston Asterisks three times in the playoffs in the last six seasons, with all instances ending in heartbreak for the New York Yankees. However, with the Astericks' cheating scandal that took place during the 2017 season, fans and players from all over the league are angered look for revenge. The 2017 season was also the closest that the Yankees have been to a World Series in years until it was stolen from them

    <h2>Upcoming Season</h2>
    <p>Entering the 2021 season, the New York Yankees face a tremendous amount of pressure to make it to the World Series after failing to do so in over a decade. With the major re-signing of key contributer, DJ LeMahieu, and the signing of former Cy Young Award Winning Pitcher, Corey Kluber, the Yankees should make it. They've also acquired a solid pitcher in Jameson Taillon and recieved bullpen help after the signing of Darren O' Day. On paper, the Yankees are the best team in the American League. The Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, Houston Asterisks, and the Chicago White Sox, seem to be the only teams that can keep up with them. However, in the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, and the San Diego Padres can certainly compete with the Yankees for a potential World Series title. The Yankees will look to see if they can achieve that goal.
