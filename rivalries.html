<h2>Rivalries</h2>
    <p>

    <h3> Boston Red Sox </h3>
      <p> One of the most well-known rivalries in sports is the rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. This rivalry originated in 1919, ever since the Boston Red Sox sold the contract of Babe Ruth, arguably the greatest player to ever play baseball, to the New York Yankees. With Babe Ruth, the Yankees experienced great success and many titles. Without him, the Red Sox struggled mightily. They weren't able to win a championship until 2004. This became known as the "Curse of the Bambino". This rivalry was intensified and put on national television during the American League Championship Series of 2003 and 2004. The two teams met with World Series appearances on the line. Both teams were able to get a victory from these series. In total, the Yankees and Red Sox have met 2,284 times. The Yankees hold the series lead with a record of 1,226-1,021-14. These games are often played with high stakes and with hatred among players and fans. </p>

  <h3> New York Mets </h3>
  <p> These close neighbors play each other every year in a series of games known as the "Subway Series". The set of games get their names from the NYC Subway System which makes it relatively for fans of both teams to reach the stadiums. Since it was introduced in 1997, fans from both teams would tune in, in an attempt to determine who "rules" the city. For all of time, the Yankees have undisputedly dominated the Mets. This rivalry was put on display during the 2000 World Series in which the Yankees won, rather easily. The rivalry also holds some memorable moments. During the 2000 World Series, Yankees pitcher, Roger Clemens, threw a broken bat at Mets catcher, Mike Piazza. During the 2009 Subway Series, Luis Castillo dropped a popup off the bat of Alex Rodriguez, giving the Yankees the win. </p>

  <h3> Houston Asterisks/Astros </h3>
    <p> This one has emerged over the past couple of years. The New York Yankees have met with the Houston Asterisks three times in the playoffs in the last six seasons, with all instances ending in heartbreak for the New York Yankees. However, with the Astericks' cheating scandal that took place during the 2017 season, fans and players from all over the league are angered look for revenge. The 2017 season was also the closest that the Yankees have been to a World Series in years until it was stolen from them. Admittedly, the Astros have had the upper hand on the Yankees. Since 2015, the Astros' overall record against New York is 26-22 and 9-5 in the playoffs. The Yankees' struggles against the Astros provide greater reason for motivation.
