This rivalry originated in 1919, ever since the Boston Red Sox sold the contract of Babe Ruth, arguably the greatest player to ever play baseball, to the New York Yankees. With Babe Ruth, the Yankees experienced great success and many titles. Without him, the Red Sox struggled mightily. They weren't able to win a championship until 2004. These games are often played with high stakes and with hatred among players and fans. </p>
