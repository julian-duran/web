<h1>History</h1>
  <p> The New York Yankees are one of the oldest organizations in Major League Baseball. They were established in 1901 where they competed in Baltimore, Maryland as the Orioles for two seasons. In 1903, the team was under new ownership when they relocated to New York City. There, they were called the New York Highlanders as they were located in one of Manhattan's highest points, Hilltop Park. In 1913, the Highlanders began to play at the Polo Grounds, just north of Central Park, and were renamed as the New York Yankees. The Yankees played in the Polo Grounds until 1922 when they moved to Yankee Stadium in the western side of the Bronx. They played in the stadium for many years until 2008. The following year the Yankees moved to a new stadium just across the street of their former home. This new stadium is also called Yankee Stadium.
