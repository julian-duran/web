<h2>History</h2>
  
  <div class="par">
  <p> The New York Yankees are one of the oldest organizations in Major League Baseball. They were established in 1901 where they competed in Baltimore, Maryland as the Orioles for two seasons. In 1903, the team was bought by Frank Farell and Bill Devery. Under this new ownership the Yankees were relocated to New York City. There, they were called the New York Highlanders as they were located in one of Manhattan's highest points, Hilltop Park. In 1913, the Highlanders began to play at the Polo Grounds, just north of Central Park, and were renamed as the New York Yankees. The Yankees played in the Polo Grounds until 1922 when they moved to Yankee Stadium in the western side of the Bronx. They played in the stadium for many years until 2008. The only exceptions were in 1974 and 1975, when the New York Yankees played in Shea Stadium along with the New York Mets, New York Jets, and the New York Giants, as Yankee Stadium was undergoing renovations. In 2009, the Yankees moved to a new stadium just across the street of their former home. This new stadium is also called Yankee Stadium. Throughout their many years of existence, the New York Yankees have repeatedly been competitive for long durations of time with few exceptions. They have not only been competitive, they have been able to field a few of the best teams in sports history. The "Murderer's Row" teams in the late 1920s captivated the eyes of many with its starpower. This lineup included greats such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Earle Combs. The Yankees' teams of the late 1990's are also considered one of the greatest teams. With the likes of Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, and Bernie Williams, the Yankees were able to win 4 championships during that time period. Consistent and aggresive leadership under George Steinbrenner and the Steinbrenner family since 1973 has also played a big role in the Yankees' successes.
