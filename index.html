  <h2>History</h2>
  <p> The New York Yankees are one of the oldest organizations in Major League Baseball. They were established in 1901 where they competed in Baltimore, Maryland as the Orioles for two seasons. In 1903, the team was under new ownership when they relocated to New York City. There, they were called the New York Highlanders as they were located in one of Manhattan's highest points, Hilltop Park. In 1913, the Highlanders began to play at the Polo Grounds, just north of Central Park, and were renamed as the New York Yankees. The Yankees played in the Polo Grounds until 1922 when they moved to Yankee Stadium in the western side of the Bronx. They played in the stadium for many years until 2008. The following year the Yankees moved to a new stadium just across the street of their former home. This new stadium is also called Yankee Stadium.

  <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
  <p> The New York Yankees are undoubtedly the most successful franchise in North American sports. The Yankees have won a grand total of 27 World Series, most recently in 2009, 40 American League Pennants, and 19 American League East Division titles. Adding on, 44 players and 11 managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Some of these greats include Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mariano Rivera, and Derek Jeter. The Yankees are also the most valuable organization in MLB, worth approximately $5 billion. This wealth allows the organization to pursue many top-tier players.
